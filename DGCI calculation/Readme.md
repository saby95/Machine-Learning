# DGCI Prediction
This project builds a model that predicts the Dark Green Colour Index (DGCI) values of turf grounds.

The main.ipynb file implements a model which uses the images from the Archive directory and the DGCI values from the 'train.csv' to train the model using convolutional neural networks. Then the model predicts the DGCI values of the testing images specified in the 'sample.csv'.

This was implemented as a part of a class competition and the model was able to achieve an RMSE of 0.0184 which was the second least in the class.
